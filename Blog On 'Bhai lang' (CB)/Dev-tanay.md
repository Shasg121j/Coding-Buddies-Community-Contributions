# Bhailang – A Toy Programming Language

The internet is being taken over by a new programming language recently. Aniket Singh of Amazon and Rishabh Tripathi of Groww are the two Indian developers who created Bhai-lang, a toy programming language. It is written in Typescript and unites Hindi bhai with English hi, bye, and other words. Bhai-lang is also employed to explain Java and other programming languages.

The code’s entry point starts with hi bhai and ends with bye bhai. Any code inside these tags will be correct, however, any outside will be missed. If a programmer makes an error, the screen says Arre Bhai Bhai Bhai!!!! Users are tweeting funny reactions to the bhailang syntax, including the prohibited Brocode, according to a user on Instagram. The language has a particular GitHub page, where visitors can see the source code and a whole directory of how to operate built-ins, conditionals, and loops.
